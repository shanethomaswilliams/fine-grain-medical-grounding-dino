This is a transfer learning ML project to test the limits of the application of the Grounding-DINO zero-shot framework.

### Open Grounding-DINO

The main backbone of this project is based on the [Open-GroundingDino](https://github.com/longzw1997/Open-GroundingDino) GitHub Repo and so all credit to them. If you are interested in which code is entirely original please look to the commit history for this repository. The original commit is the Open-GroundingDINO repo and all commits after will be augmentations from that core code.
